# About our project:

This repository is a result of collaborative work of a group of five 
students. Our goal was to create a chatbot for whatsapp that easily
gives access to weather data for a location and time the user chooses
without leaving WhatsApp. Then in one workflow the chatbot suggests 
events at the location the user chose. So you do not have to scroll in
event booking websites while your friends chat on in WhatsApp. Everybody
can easily share the results for events with the friends in the chat app
without needing lots of technical skills. So our app is accessible for
people of all ages and backgrounds. This code is a mvp version at the
moment. Further technical features, like artificial intelligence for
the chatbot answers can be integrated in the future.

# Technical information:

The app runs on the twilio communications api to enable chatting via
WhatsAPP. The weather data comes from the weatherapi.com api. Our event
data comes from the ticketmaster.com api. For accessing all the three 
apis you need to register on your own and add your private secret data 
like api keys and so on in your own .env file on your local repository.

# Further Requirements:

Our App is programmed in Python and we imported the following libraries:
    - requests
    - os
    - dotenv
    - json
    - twilio.rest
